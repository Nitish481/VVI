write a c program where a list of integers(A) I to n is stored randomly in an array. In another list, there are n integep stored in a Queue(B). Manage queue Bin such a way that the dequeue(B), ie, deletion of clements from the queue, will be done in the order given in list A. Queue to be implemented using a circular linkedlist (C). As a restriction imposed by ADT, you are not allowed to access storage(C) directly.
